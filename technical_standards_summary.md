# Technical Standards Summary

Our project implements a robust architecture following industry best practices to ensure maintainability, security, and scalability. We employ the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with RESTful endpoints to create a clear separation of concerns, while utilizing Singleton patterns for key components like BackendManager, EmbeddingFactory, TokenManager, and CognitoVerifier to simplify state management and resource access. Authentication is handled through AWS Cognito, leveraging JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0 protocols to provide secure, standardized authentication flows, while SQLAlchemy serves as our ORM to maintain consistent database state and abstract database operations.

The frontend architecture follows a component-based design pattern, enabling reuse across multiple platforms (iOS, web, Android) and improving development efficiency. Our system architecture consists of decoupled monoliths in Docker containers, providing compartmentalization that enhances security and allows for future migration to more distributed architectures if needed. Security is prioritized through secure storage mechanisms within Cognito and Expo, abstracting device-level security concerns, while Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented for the Admin panel to ensure appropriate access permissions.

Quality assurance is maintained through a rigorous code review process where all changes must be accompanied by tested Pull Requests, with approvers required to test branches before merging. This comprehensive approach to standards ensures our system remains secure, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements while providing a consistent experience across platforms.
